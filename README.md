#### :clock1: Deprecation & Repository Status

**Update June 28, 2016:** This library has not been in active development for quite some time, but may still serve as a basic boilerplate for how to connect a middleware server such as Express to the Cloud Elements services. As of 2016, the NPM world offers many different ways of distributing your applications via middleware and creating RESTful services that hide authorization keys. 

You may still find the application useful, however I would strongly reccommend including build tools, tests, and using this code as a starting point to further expand upon. I am keeping this repository at it's current state for posterity, and for those who may find it's functionality useful. In the future, we may bring this to an actual major point release, but for now -- we are leaving this for posterity at 0.8 beta.

Thank you,
@cephil

### DEMO
[Cloud File Browser Demo](http://filebrowser.io/) 



### Description
Cloud File Browser is a javascript library to connect to Document Hub provider (e.g. Dropbox, Box,
Google Drive) by creating Cloud Elements instances, this library uses nodejs on the backend for connecting to Cloud
Elements API by not exposing any keys or tokens to outside world.

---
### Requirements  
* Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>
* Express <http://expressjs.com/>
* jQuery 2+ <http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js>
  
 Setup and create of application for the each document provider. Find the document for setting up application for the
provider 



## Setup


### STEP 1
There are two ways of installing the required scripts for the Cloud File Browser:

1. Include the desired version of jQuery & minified cfb.min.js script in your HTML HEAD tag,
and the script will build all the required client-side scripts on your page.

```html
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://filebrowser.io/v1/cfb.js"></script>
```

2. or alternatively, you may host the plugin by including the lib, img, fonts, css folders and callback.html in your
web application.

```html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/font-awesome.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />

<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="lib/cloudfilebrowser.js"></script>
<script src="lib//provision.js"></script>
```
### STEP 2
Define the HTML section where you would like the file browser to appear:

```html
<section class="cloudFileBrowser"></section>
```

and initialize the client-side scripting using jQuery as follows:

```javascript
$('.cloudFileBrowser').cloudFileBrowser({
      callback: mycallbackfunction
      env: 'http://localhost:8888/elements/'
});
```
#### Configuration Options  
 **callback** - Function that gets invoked when an action happens, 'select' - when a file is selected by
user, 'create' - when an element instance is created when user authorizes your application. Format of callback
function is

```javascript
    function mycallback(type, response)
    {
        console.log('Callback for type ' + type + ' with response ' + JSON.stringify(response));
    };
```
response in callback example
```javascript
    {
        'element': box,
        'elementToken': 'cAhB2y64CMJv28BcnVlEXBb7pmQm1wW',
        'action' : 'create'
    }
```
```javascript
    {
        'element': box,
        'selectedFile': '/fakepath/fakefile.jpg',
        'action' : 'select'
    }
```
 **env** - The node server URL that running at.

### STEP 3
Obtain your Organization Secret key and User Secret key from your Cloud-Elements account, and place them in your server.js file (line 84-85)  

These keys are the required Authorization headers for invoking the Cloud Elemnts API
  
---  
### STEP 4  
Set up the providers you would like to use in server.js, if you don't mention the provider in the documents it doesn't show up on the screen.  

Supported documents providers are box, dropbox, googledrive, onedrive, sharepoint example:

```javascript
documents = {
        'box': {
            'apiKey': 'q3kuw28dqdkirsesgjtwreutuwnu8djg4499',
            'apiSecret': 'jZGbIgjhgGJhnkKJaOLMA8HXgsbb3TkcXo4iKnD',
            'callbackUrl': 'http://localhost:8080/callback.html'
        },

        'dropbox': {
            'apiKey': '9kyxmsmhdfh8xn2m4',
            'apiSecret': 'trap7ksmgbsdfa71xzh',
            'callbackUrl': 'http://localhost:8080/callback.html'
        },

        'googledrive': {
            'apiKey': '282923532784-t89r45pvo4nuo49l6clpfa6b8mkkgnnu.apps.googleusercontent.com',
            'apiSecret': 'uErA1R7L4BAxZdgKW20VcqpE',
            'callbackUrl': 'http://localhost:8080/callback.html'
        },

        'onedrive' : {
            'elementToken' : 'wL8dSSeddRkje3V6ftWy6/XJhUJH3oJHSRA7/miR+C4='
        },

        'sharepoint' : {
            'elementToken' : 'cAhB2y64CMJv28BcnVlEXBb7pmQm1wW+uW1muJS2LdY='
        }
}
```
### Configuration Options

| Key        | Description |
| ----------------- |:-------------:|
| **apiKey**        | The client ID or API key or App key of your provider application. |
| **apiSecret**     | The client secret or App secret of your provider application.     |
| **callbackUrl**   | The redirect uri once the OAuth2 approval is done,this needs to be callback.html|
| **elementToken**  | This is the Cloud Elements instance token, if an elementToken is present it takes the priority over the other configs. You can pass in the elementToken based on user login to your application|

The required scripts and markup are ready to go! Start up your node server by opening your terminal and finding the directory you've downloaded the Cloud File Browser to, and type:

```javascript
node server.js
```

#### And you're all set!

---
## Examples

You can find the examples of using the Cloud File Browser under examples folder and in index.html  

---
#### Example1
index.html shows you how to use Cloud File Browser, by just including the cfb.js which loads all the client side
sources

---
#### Example2
filebrowser1.html shows you how to use Cloud File Browser by downloading the source and using it in your web application.

---
#### Example3
filebrowser2.html shows you how to use Cloud File Browser in a modal window.

---
## Code

#### **server.js**
This is the Node.js server that handles the Organization Secret and User Secret, and routes them to the appropriate Cloud-Elements API call.

#### **lib/provision.js**
